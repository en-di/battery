# Battery

Web app to keep track of one's energy levels and plan tasks accordingly.

## Definition

I, as a user, want to see how much mental energy I have, so I can plan my activities better.

I, as a user, want to keep track of my activities and how each affects me, so I can determine which activities drain and replenish me and to what extent.

I, as a user, want to keep track of tasks I need to complete, so that I won't accidentally forget something important.

I, as a user, want to see predicted levels of "battery" after I complete my to-do list, so that I will be able to stay motivated and feel accomplished by avoiding over- and under-comitting myself.

(Nice to have): I, as a user, want to save my data across devices, so that I won't lose statistics and prediction data
